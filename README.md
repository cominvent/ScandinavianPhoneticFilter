ScandinavianPhoneticFilter
==========================

This is a phonetic filter forked from DoubleMetaphone with added support
for Swedish and Norwegian phonetics. The initial work was done by
[Findwise AB](http://www.findwise.se/) and further work by [Cominvent](http://cominvent.com)
 
The filter can be used with Lucene, Solr and Elasticsearch.
